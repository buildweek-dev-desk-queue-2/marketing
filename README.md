## DevDesk Marketing Pages
The design of the marketing pages for this app was inspired by a new design trend called Neomorphism. 

The essence of the design is adding a drop shadow that functions as a highlight on the opposing side of a the regular drop shadow, thus, making elements look as if they are popping off the page in a modern, non-tacky way.

## Landing Page

Our landing page was meant to emulate that of a modern web-app's landing page. Simple and elegant, with all need-to-know information "right there". 

## About Page

Our about page contains our team's mission statement, and some brief copy about our product and team. The page also contains a section containing all team members that were a part of the project.
